<h2>Annotation: Reinforcement learning</h2>
<p>Text: Suppose you‚Äôre moving along a tunnel, Indiana Jones‚Äìlike, and you come to a  fork.  Your  map  says  the  left  tunnel  leads  to  a  treasure  and  the  right  one  to  a snake  pit.  The  value  of  where  you‚Äôre  standing‚Äîright  before  the  fork‚Äîis  the value of the treasure because you‚Äôll choose to go left. If you always choose the best  possible  action,  then  the  value  of  a  state  differs  from  the  value  of  the succeeding  state  only  by  the  immediate  reward  (if  any)  that  you‚Äôll  get  by performing  that  action.  If  we  know  each  state‚Äôs  immediate  reward,  we  can  use this  observation  to  update  the  values  of  neighboring  states,  and  so  on,  until  all states  have  consistent  values.  The  treasure‚Äôs  value  propagates  backward  along the tunnel until it reaches the fork and beyond. Once you know the value of each state,  you  also  know  which  action  to  choose  in  each  state  (the  one  that maximizes  the  combination  of  immediate  reward  and  value  of  the  resulting state).  This  much  was  worked  out  in  the  1950s  by  the  control  theorist  Richard Bellman. But the real problem in reinforcement learning is when you don‚Äôt have a  map  of  the  territory.  Then  your  only  choice  is  to  explore  and  discover  what rewards are where. Sometimes you‚Äôll discover a treasure, and other times you‚Äôll fall  into  a  snake  pit.  Every  time  you  take  an  action,  you  note  the  immediate reward and the resulting state. That much could be done by supervised learning.
 But you also update the value of the state you just came from to bring it into line with  the  value  you  just  observed,  namely  the  reward  you  got  plus  the  value  of the new state you‚Äôre in. Of course, that value may not yet be the correct one, but if you wander around doing this for long enough, you‚Äôll eventually settle on the right values for all the states and the corresponding actions. That‚Äôs reinforcement learning in a nutshell.

<h2>Annotation: Nice diagram of the master algorithm</h2>
<p>Text: The Master Algorithm
 Our  unified  learner  is  perhaps  best  introduced  through  an  extended  allegory.  If machine learning is a continent divided into the territories of the five tribes, the Master Algorithm is its capital city, standing on the unique spot where the five territories meet. As you approach it from a distance, you can see that the city is made up of three concentric circles, each bounded by a wall. The outer and by far  widest  circle  is  Optimization  Town.  Each  house  here  is  an  algorithm,  and they come in all shapes and sizes. Some are under construction, the locals busy around them; some are gleaming new; and some look old and abandoned. Higher up the hill lies the Citadel of Evaluation. From its mansions and palaces orders issue  continuously  to  the  algorithms  below.  Above  all,  silhouetted  against  the sky,  rise  the  Towers  of  Representation.  Here  live  the  rulers  of  the  city.  Their immutable  laws  set  forth  what  can  and  cannot  be  done  not  just  in  the  city  but throughout  the </p>

<h2>Annotation: Most computing in AI are like that</h2>
<p>Text: Two  things  are  similar  if  they  agree  with  one  another  in  some  respects.  If  they agree  in  some  respects,  they  will  probably  also  agree  in  others.  This  is  the essence  of  analogy.  It  also  points  to  the  two  main  subproblems  in  analogical reasoning:  figuring  out  how  similar  two  things  are  and  deciding  what  else  to infer  from  their  similarities.  So  far  we‚Äôve  explored  the  ‚Äúlow  power‚Äù  end  of analogy, with algorithms like nearest-neighbor and SVMs, where the answers to both  these  questions  are  very  simple.  They</p>

<h2>Annotation: Today companies dont have real data of us</h2>
<p>Text: No one has anything even  approaching  a  complete  picture  of  you.  That‚Äôs  both  good  and  bad.  Good because if someone did, they‚Äôd have far too much power. Bad because as long as that‚Äôs the case there can be no 360-degree model of you. What you really want is a  digital  you  that  you‚Äôre  the  sole  owner  of  and  that  others  can  access  only  on your terms.

<h2>Annotation: Use machine to improve. It's pro machine but as machine are more and more present it's inevitable,better to use their benefits</h2>
<p>Text: It‚Äôs not man versus machine; it‚Äôs man with machine versus man without. Data and intuition are like horse and rider, and you don‚Äôt try to outrun a horse; you ride it.
 As technology progresses, an ever more intimate mix of human and machine takes shape. You‚Äôre hungry; Yelp suggests some good restaurants. You pick one; GPS gives you directions. You drive; car electronics does the low-level control.
 We are all cyborgs already. The real story of automation is not what it replaces but what it enables. Some professions disappear, but many more are born. Most of  all,  automation  makes  all  sorts  of  things  possible  that  would  be  way  too expensive if done by humans. </p>

<h2>Annotation: Learn by chunk</h2>
<p>Text: They  found  that  humans  solve  problems  by  decomposing  them  into subproblems,  subsubproblems,  and  so  on  and  systematically  reducing  the differences between the initial state (the first formula, say) and the goal state (the second formula). Doing so requires searching for a sequence of actions that will work,  however,  and  that  takes  time.  Newell  and  Rosenbloom‚Äôs  hypothesis  was that  each  time  we  solve  a  subproblem,  we  form  a  chunk  that  allows  us  to  go directly from the state before we solve it to the state after. A chunk in this sense has two parts: the stimulus (a pattern you recognize in the external world or in your short-term memory) and the response (the sequence of actions you execute as  a  result).  Once  you‚Äôve  learned  a  chunk,  you  store  it  in  long-term  memory.
 Next time you have to solve the same subproblem, you can just apply the chunk, and  save  the  time  spent  searching.  This  happens  at  all  levels  until  you  have  a chunk  for  the  whole  problem  and  can  solve  it  automatically.  To  tie  your shoelaces,  you  tie  the  starting  knot,  make  a  loop  with  one  end,  wrap  the  other end  around  it,  and  pull  it  through  the  hole  in  the  middle.  Each  of  these  is  far from  trivial  for  a  five-year-old,  but  once  you‚Äôve  acquired  the  corresponding chunks, you‚Äôre almost there.

<h2>Annotation: AGI will be a universal learning unifying all learners</h2>
<p>Text: Machine  learning  is  both  a  science  and  a  technology,  and  both  characteristics give  us  hints  on  how  to  unify  it.  On  the  science  side,  unifying  theories  often begin  with  a  deceptively  simple  observation.  Two  seemingly  unrelated phenomena  turn  out  to  be  just  two  faces  of  the  same  coin,  and  like  the  first domino  to  fall,  that  realization  sets  off  a  cascade  of  others.  An  apple  falling  to the  ground,  the  moon  hanging  in  the  sky:  both  are  caused  by  gravity,  and‚Äî apocryphal  story  or  not‚Äîonce  Newton  figured  out  how,  gravity  turned  out  to also  account  for  the  tides,  the  precession  of  the  equinoxes,  the  trajectories  of comets,  and  much  else.  In  everyday  experience,  electricity  and  magnetism  are never seen together: a lightning spark here, a rock that attracts iron objects there, both  quite  rare.  But  once  Maxwell  figured  out  how  a  changing  electric  field gives  rise  to  magnetism  and  vice  versa,  it  became  clear  that  light  itself  is  an intimate  marriage  of  the  two,  and  today  we  know  that,  far  from  rare, electromagnetism  pervades  all  matter.  Mendeleev‚Äôs  periodic  table  not  only organized  all  the  known  elements  into  just  two  dimensions,  it  also  predicted where new elements would be found. Darwin‚Äôs observations aboard the  Beagle suddenly  began  to  make  sense  when  Malthus‚Äôs   Essay  on  Population  suggested natural selection as the organizing principle. When Crick and Watson hit on the double helix structure as an explanation for the puzzling properties of DNA, they immediately  saw  how  it  might  replicate  itself,  and  biology‚Äôs  transition  from stamp collecting (in Rutherford‚Äôs pejorative words) to unified science had begun.
 In each of these cases, a bewildering variety of observations turned out to </p>

<h2>Annotation: As of today, machine will enable more usefulness per time for overall human creation</h2>
<p>Text:  We  worry  that  the humanities  are  in  a  death  spiral,  but  they‚Äôll  rise  from  the  ashes  once  other professions  have  been  automated.  The  more  everything  is  done  cheaply  by machines, the more valuable the humanist‚Äôs contribution will be.

<h2>Annotation: There will be a transition in wich inequality will be high. Gouvernements will switch the human benefits to unemployment, people wanting to work will earn lot of money.As machine will produce and replace them and be more productive, economy will keep the treshold and probably skyrocket</h2>
<p>Text: 
 In the meantime, as the boundary between automatable and non-automatable jobs  advances  across  the  economic  landscape,  what  we‚Äôll  likely  see  is unemployment creeping up, downward pressure on the wages of more and more professions,  and  increasing  rewards  for  the  fewer  and  fewer  that  can‚Äôt  yet  be automated. This is what‚Äôs already happening, of course, but it has much further to run. The transition will be tumultuous, but thanks to democracy, it will have a happy  ending.  (Hold  on  to  your  vote‚Äîit  may  be  the  most  valuable  thing  you have.)  When  the  unemployment  rate  rises  above  50  percent,  or  even  before, attitudes  about  redistribution  will  radically  change.  The  newly  unemployed majority will vote for generous lifetime unemployment benefits and the sky-high taxes  needed  to  fund  them.  These  won‚Äôt  break  the  bank  because  machines  will do  the  necessary  production.  Eventually,  we‚Äôll  start  talking  about  the employment rate instead of the unemployment one and reducing it will be seen as a sign of progress. (‚ÄúThe US is falling behind. Our employment rate is still 23
 percent.‚Äù)  Unemployment  benefits  will  be  replaced  by  a  basic  income  for everyone.  Those  of  us  who  aren‚Äôt  satisfied  with  it  will  be  able  to  earn  more, stupendously  more,  in  the  few  remaining  human  occupations.  Liberals  and conservatives  will  still  fight  about</p>

<h2>Annotation: Machines in war</h2>
<p>Text: Soldiering is harder to automate than science, but it will be as well. One of the prime  uses  of  robots  is  to  do  things  that  are  too  dangerous  for  humans,  and fighting wars is about as dangerous as it gets. Robots already defuse bombs, and drones allow a platoon to see over the hill. Self-driving supply trucks and robotic mules are on the way. Soon we will need to decide whether robots are allowed to pull the trigger on their own. The argument for doing this is that we want to get humans  out  of  harm‚Äôs  way,  and  remote  control  is  not  viable  in  fast-moving, shoot-or-be-shot situations. The argument against is that robots don‚Äôt understand ethics,  and  so  can‚Äôt  be  entrusted  with  life-or-death  decisions.  But  we  can  teach them. The deeper question is whether we‚Äôre ready to.

<h2>Annotation: Machine are better at uniform decision making.</h2>
<p>Text: First, teach the robot to recognize the relevant concepts, for example with  data  sets  of  situations  where  civilians  were  and  were  not  spared,  armed response  was  and  was  not  proportional,  and  so  on.  Then  give  it  a  code  of conduct in the form of rules involving these concepts. Finally, let the robot learn how to apply the code by observing humans: the soldier opened fire in this case but not in that case. By generalizing from these examples, the robot can learn an end-to-end model of ethical decision making, in the form of, say, a large MLN.
 Once  the  robot‚Äôs  decisions  agree  with  a  human‚Äôs  as  often  as  one  human  agrees with another, the training is complete, meaning the model is ready for download into  thousands  of  robot  brains.  Unlike  humans,  robots  don‚Äôt  lose  their  heads  in the heat of combat. If a robot malfunctions, the manufacturer is responsible. If it makes a wrong call, its teachers are.

<h2>Annotation: Machine is already part of most of our world. Dont fear the sci-fi predictions</h2>
<p>Text: The  point  where  we  could  turn  off  all  our  computers  without  causing  the collapse  of  modern  civilization  has  long  passed.  Machine  learning  is  the  last straw:  if  computers  can  start  programming  themselves,  all  hope  of  controlling them  is  surely  lost.  Distinguished  scientists  like  Stephen  Hawking  have  called for urgent research on this issue before it‚Äôs too late.
 Relax. The chances that an AI equipped with the Master Algorithm will take
 over the world are  zero.  The  reason  is  simple:  unlike  humans,  computers  don‚Äôt have a will of their own. They‚Äôre products of engineering, not evolution. Even an infinitely  powerful  computer  would  still  be  only  an  extension  of  our  will  and nothing  to  fear.  Recall  the  three  components  of  every  learning  algorithm: representation,  evaluation,  and  optimization.  The  learner‚Äôs  representation circumscribes what it can learn. Let‚Äôs make it a very powerful one, like Markov logic,  so  the  learner  can  in  principle  learn  anything.  The  optimizer  then  does everything  in  its  power  to  maximize  the  evaluation  function‚Äîno  more  and  no less‚Äîand  the  evaluation  function  is   determined  by  us.</p>

<h2>Annotation: #DNA / AI comparison</h2>
<p>Text: This  means  we  can continue  to  control  it  even  if  it  becomes  far  more  complex  than  we  can understand.
 Picture  two  strands  of  DNA  going  for  a  swim  in  their  private  pool,  aka  a bacterium‚Äôs  cytoplasm,  two  billion  years  ago.  They‚Äôre  pondering  a  momentous decision.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm  worried,  Diana,‚Äù  says  one.  ‚ÄúIf  we  start  making  multicellular creatures,  will  they  take  over?‚Äù  Fast-forward  to  the  twenty-first  century,  and DNA is still alive and well. Better than ever, in fact, with an increasing fraction living safely in bipedal organisms comprising trillions of cells. It‚Äôs been quite a ride  for  our  tiny  double-stranded  friends  since  they  made  their  momentous decision.  Humans  are  their  trickiest  creation  yet;  we‚Äôve  invented  things  like contraception that let us have fun without spreading our DNA, and we have‚Äîor seem  to  have‚Äîfree  will.  But  it‚Äôs  still  DNA  that  shapes  our  notions  of  fun,  and we use our free will to pursue pleasure and avoid pain, which, for the most part, still  coincides  with  what‚Äôs  best  for  our  DNA‚Äôs  survival.  We  may  yet  be  DNA‚Äôs demise if we choose to transmute ourselves into silicon, but even then, it‚Äôs been a  great  two  billion  years.

<p>Text: Children raised by robot nannies will have a lifelong soft  spot  for  kindly  electronic  friends.  The  ‚Äúuncanny  valley‚Äù‚Äîour  discomfort with  robots  that  are  almost  human  but  not  quite‚Äîwill  be  unknown  to  them because they grew up with robot mannerisms and maybe even adopted them as cool teenagers.

<h2>Annotation: #Humans will always drive actions to what they can understand# Even if it means technology advancement will suffer from that</h2>
<p>Text: As  a  matter  of  fact,  we‚Äôve  always  lived  in  a  world  that  we  only  partly understood.  The  main  difference  is  that  our  world  is  now  partly  created  by  us, which is surely an improvement. The world beyond the Turing point will not be incomprehensible to us, any more than the Pleistocene was. We‚Äôll focus on what we can understand, as we always have, and call the rest random (or divine).
 The trajectory we‚Äôre on is not a singularity but a phase transition. Its critical point‚Äîthe  Turing  point‚Äîwill  come  when  machine  learning  overtakes  the natural variety. Natural learning itself has gone through three phases: evolution, the  brain,  and  culture.  Each  is  a  product  of  the  previous  one,  and  each  learns faster. Machine learning is the logical next stage of this progression. Computer programs are the fastest replicators on Earth: copying them takes only a fraction of a second. But creating them is slow, if it has to be done by humans. Machine learning removes that bottleneck, leaving a final one: the speed at which humans can  absorb  change.  This  too  will  eventually  be  removed,  but  not  because  we‚Äôll decide  to  hand  things  off  to  our  ‚Äúmind  children,‚Äù  as  Hans  Moravec  calls  them, and  go  gently  into  the  good  night.  Humans  are  not  a  dying  twig  on  the  tree  of life. On the contrary, we‚Äôre about to start branching.

<h2>Annotation: Multiple humans will result from technologic evolution </h2>
<p>Text: Many people worry that human-directed evolution will permanently split the human race into a class of genetic haves and one of have-nots. This strikes me as a  singular  failure  of  imagination.  Natural  evolution  did  not  result  in  just  two species,  one  subservient  to  the  other,  but  in  an  infinite  variety  of  creatures  and intricate  ecosystems.  Why  would  artificial  evolution,  building  on  it  but  less constrained, do so?

<h2>Annotation: How to start learning</h2>
<p>Text: data  sets  from  the  UCI repository (archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) and start playing. When you‚Äôre ready, check out  Kaggle.com,   a  whole  website  dedicated  to  running  machine-learning competitions,  and  pick  one  or  two  to  enter.  Of  course,  it‚Äôll  be  more  fun  if  you recruit  a  friend  or  two  to  work  with  you.  If  you‚Äôre  hooked,  like  Jeff  was,  and wind up becoming a professional data scientist, welcome to the most fascinating job  in  the  world.  If  you  find  yourself  dissatisfied  with  today‚Äôs  learners,  invent new  ones‚Äîor  just  do  it  for  fun.  My  fondest  wish  is  that  your  reaction  to  this book will be like my reaction to the first AI book I read, over twenty years ago: there‚Äôs so much to do here, I don‚Äôt know where to start. If one day you invent the Master  Algorithm,  please  don‚Äôt  run  to  the  patent  office  with  it.  Open-source  it.

<h2>Annotation: Final quote</h2>
<p>Text: 
 Newton said that he felt like a boy playing on the seashore, picking up a pebble here and a shell there while the great ocean of truth lay undiscovered before him.
 Three hundred years later, we‚Äôve gathered an amazing collection of pebbles and shells, but the great undiscovered ocean still stretches into the distance, sparkling with promise. The gift is a boat‚Äîmachine learning‚Äîand it‚Äôs time to set sail.

 Prologue
 An  early  list  of  examples  of  machine  learning‚Äôs  impact  on  daily  life  can  be  found  in  ‚ÄúBehind-the-scenes data mining,‚Äù by George John ( SIGKDD Explorations, 1999), which was also the inspiration for the ‚Äúday-in-the-life‚Äù  paragraphs  of  the  prologue.  Eric  Siegel‚Äôs  book   Predictive  Analytics  (Wiley,  2013)  surveys  a large number of machine-learning applications. The term  big data was popularized by the McKinsey Global Institute‚Äôs 2011 report  Big Data: The Next Frontier for Innovation, Competition, and Productivity. Many of the issues raised by big data are discussed in  Big Data: A Revolution That Will Change How We Live, Work, and  Think,  by  Viktor  Mayer-Sch√∂nberger  and  Kenneth  Cukier  (Houghton  Mifflin </p>

<p>Text: Harcourt,  2013).  The textbook I learned AI from is  Artificial Intelligence,* by Elaine Rich (McGraw-Hill, 1983). A current one is Artificial  Intelligence:  A  Modern  Approach,  by  Stuart  Russell  and  Peter  Norvig  (3rd  ed.,  Prentice  Hall, 2010).  Nils  Nilsson‚Äôs   The  Quest  for  Artificial  Intelligence  (Cambridge  University  Press,  2010)  tells  the story of AI from its earliest days.
 Chapter One
 Nine  Algorithms  That  Changed  the  Future,  by  John  MacCormick  (Princeton  University  Press,  2012), describes some of the most important algorithms in computer science, with a chapter on machine learning.
 Algorithms,* by Sanjoy Dasgupta, Christos Papadimitriou, and Umesh Vazirani (McGraw-Hill, 2008), is a concise  introductory  textbook  on  the  subject.  The  Pattern  on  the  Stone,  by  Danny  Hillis  (Basic  Books, 1998),  explains  how  computers  work.  Walter  Isaacson  recounts  the  lively  history  of  computer  science  in The Innovators (Simon & Schuster, 2014).
 ‚ÄúSpreadsheet  data  manipulation  using  examples,‚Äù*  by  Sumit  Gulwani,  William  Harris,  and  Rishabh Singh ( Communications of the ACM, 2012), is an example of how  computers  can  program  themselves  by observing users.  Competing  on  Analytics,  by  Tom  Davenport  and  Jeanne  Harris  (HBS  Press,  2007),  is  an introduction to the use of predictive analytics in business.  In the Plex, by Steven Levy (Simon & Schuster, 2011), describes at a high level how Google‚Äôs technology works. Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian explain the network  effect  in   Information  Rules  (HBS  Press,  1999).  Chris  Anderson  does  the  same  for  the  long-tail phenomenon in  The Long Tail (Hyperion, 2006).
